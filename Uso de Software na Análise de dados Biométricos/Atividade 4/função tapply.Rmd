#Função Tapply
tapply(vector, index, function)


```{r}
#Exemplo

Ref_Laranjeira <- c(0.0561,0.0548,0.2061,0.1568,
                    0.1668,0.1685,0.0846,0.0681,
                    0.0645,0.0845,0.2141,0.2168,
                    0.0513,0.0566,0.0476,0.0684,
                    0.2168) #vetor de resposta

Bandas <- c("B1","B2","B7","B5","B5","B5","B4",
            "B3","B3","B4","B7","B7","B1","B2",
            "B1","B4","B7")

bandas_f <- factor(Bandas)  #vetor de fatores 
#indicando os grupos experimentais
```

```{r}
#Média
Média <- tapply(Ref_Laranjeira,bandas_f,mean)
round(Média,3)
```

```{r}
#Desvio Padrao
sd <- tapply(Ref_Laranjeira, bandas_f, sd)

```

```{r}
#Variancia
var <- tapply(Ref_Laranjeira,bandas_f,var)
